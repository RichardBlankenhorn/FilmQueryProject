# Film Query Project

- The goal of this project is to utilize JDBC to query films and actors from a database
- When the user starts the application, they may either obtain a film based upon the film ID or they may obtain a film based upon a search keyword.
- The user may also exit the application at the beginning.
- If no film is found based upon the film ID or keyword, a message stating so is presented to the user.
- The user will also be given an error message if they enter an invalid option or value for the user menu.
- After a user inputs a valid film ID, they will be given the film title, release year, rating, description, language the film is in along with all the actors starring in the film.
- If multiple films are returned based upon the search keyword, all films with the title, release year, rating, description, language and cast will be displayed to the user.
